# Looking for the gtfs data for greensboro
# General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)

# greensboro >> GTA (Greensboro Transition Authority)/HEAT (Higher Education Area Transit)


# PART (Piedmont Area Regional Transport)
# https://transit.land/feed-registry/operators/o-dnr-piedmontauthorityforregionaltransportation


# With the GTA, we probably mainly care about lines: 21 (yellow), 22 (blue), 23 (green) and 24 (purple)
